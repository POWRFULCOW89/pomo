# Pomo
Pomodoro clock (25+5) made in React.

## Description
The [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a productivity technique that allows to break work into more manageable pieces by introducing frequent breaks. The technique is carried out as follows:

- Set a task.
- Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
- Work on the task.
- End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
- After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

The pomodoro and break timers can be customized to fit different productivity styles.
